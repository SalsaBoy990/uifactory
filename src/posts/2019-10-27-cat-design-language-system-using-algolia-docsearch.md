excerpt: >-
  I am trying to sum up my UI design workflow, e.g. the set of principles,
  tricks I use, guideline I follow etc. In order to speed up and make my design
  proccess more effective. So, I am working on a design language system of a
  kind called CAT.
type: blog

CAT is based on three pillars:
- Common sense (hold on to conventions, keep good practices worked in the past)
- Adaptibility (to the newest trends, open to new ideas, concepts, and innovations)
- Timelessness Design (combine common sense with adaptibility to be always up-to-date)

The CAT website is completely static
