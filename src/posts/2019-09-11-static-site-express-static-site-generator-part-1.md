This blogpost will be a part of a series in which I will show you a design and development workflow I am currently working on. The goal is to speed up the processes and work more efficiently. Now, let's write about frontend development using the JAMStack.

There are two distinct approaches when it comes to websites:

1. either you build a **static website**,
2. or a **dynamic website** (generally an application).

I will cover the first one here. Generally, you need to use some kind of a **static site generator** (SSG) to generate your website into a specific folder. You need a way to effectively manage your posts, various assets and files.

There are countless SSGs in the market, the most popular ones are:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (based on Ruby, templates: Liquid)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (based on Go, templates: Liquid)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (based on JavaScript, templates: React)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (based on JavaScript, templates: React)
- you can [check out the rest here.](https://www.staticgen.com/)

## The JAMStack

Static site generators are using the JAMStack architecture. The short definition is:

> A modern architecture —
Create fast and secure sites and dynamic apps with **J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and prerendered **M**arkup, served without web servers.

The three core component of JAMstack are:

### 1. JavaScript
Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript.

### 2. APIs
All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.

### 3. Markup
Templated markup should be prebuilt at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.

The JAMStack approach has many advantages:
- Better Performance
- Cheaper, Easier Scaling
- Higher Security
- Better Developer Experience

### Short history of the JAMStack

**2015:**
Static sites are becoming popular due to the popularity of certain SSG such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

**2016:**
A small group of developers believe that Static sites don't have to be static and the term "JAMstack" comes to life.

**2017:**
The modern web revolution starts prioritising the importance of performance, scalability and developer experience. The term JAMstack starts to be adopted by a wider group of developers and the first enterprise JAMstack projects are announced.

**2018:**
Tools like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and Contentful have helped promote the term and the community is rapidly growing. This was also the year of the first JAMstack Conference.

## static-site-express is a SSG written in Node.js

### The beginnings
My first encounter with static site generators was around 2017. I found [the blog of Michael Lee](https://michaelsoolee.com/jekyll-field-guide/), a NYC-based web developer where I read about Jekyll, one of the most-widely used SSGs out there. My first websites were based on Jekyll and I used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I use GitHub for version control.

After that, I switched to using the [Netlify cloud platform](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify is a San Francisco-based cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for static websites. At that time, I was wondering what if I could use a custom-made SSG to build my static site using Netlify. It turned out it is easy to do: just need to tell Netlify the build command (the script to run) and the name of your folder to where your site is generated. Just create a configuration file with the name and extension in the root of your website: `netlify.toml`, and set these properties:

````
[build]
  base    = "/"
  publish = "public"
  command = "npm run build"
````
Netlify will automatically install Node.js and your npm packages listed in your `package.json` file, and run your script. The idea of making a static site generator in Node.js came from this good article by Douglas Matoso: [Build a static site generator in 40 lines with Node.js](https://medium.com/douglas-matoso-english/build-static-site-generator-nodejs-8969ebe34b22).


## Documentation


### Install static-site-express

You have to options:

a) Clone my repository:

````raw
git clone https://github.com/SalsaBoy990/static-site-express name-of-your-site
````

b) Use the 'Deploy to Netlify' button on the [example website](https://static-site-express.netlify.com/)


### Build your site locally

a) Build site from `./src` into `./public` folder:

````raw
npm run build
````

b) Serve website on `localhost:4000`:

````raw
npm run serve
````

c) Or you can watch for changes and trigger re-build with nodemon:

````raw
npm run watch
````

You need to add `sudo` before the commands on Linux system.

#### Important notes

- `nodemon` not trigger re-build on Linux on file changes (this behavior was experienced on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver)
- On Ubuntu, you can run `npm run watch-exp` command which uses the [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) package. *Experimental!*

Inspect `package.json` for more info. The `./lib` folder contains the JavaScript files used for building and serving the website. Check them out.

The `site.config.js` file contains some of the site properties (like site title, author, description, social media links etc.) that are used in the EJS partials.


### Register at Netlify and publish your website

- Register on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and [see this tutorial video](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) if you are unfamiliar with the procedure. You can publish your site in a minute.

- The `netlify.toml` configuration file contains important properties:

````raw
[build]
  base    = "/"
  publish = "public"
  command = "npm run build"
````

The base path, the build command, and the publish directory. You can keep those settings.

In the `_headers` file you can specify the HTTP headers and set Content Security Policy (CSP) rules for the Netlify server. Currently, CSP rules are not set because I don't know which domains you want to whitelist when you create your own website. I recommend you the [CSP Evaluator by Google](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/).

The `_redirects` file is currently empty. When you have a custom domain, you can make a redirect from *.netlify.com to your custom domain.

`sitemap.xml` is self-explanatory. Empty by default.
`robots.txt` is for search engines. Default settings:

```raw
# Disallow login page
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/

# Rule 2
User-agent: *
Allow: /
````

For [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) verification, you should have an HTML file from Google included in the root of your Netlify publish folder (in our case, public). The build script copies this file from `./src` to `./public`. Change line 87 in `./lib/build.js`: 

````javascript
ssg.copyRootFile('FILENAME.html', srcPath, distPath)
````

### Alternatively, you can use the Express server app on Heroku (not recommended)

A `Procfile` is already supplied for you with the command to build the site, and after that, to run the app server:

````raw
web: npm run heroku
````

You need improve security! I already set security headers with the `helmet` npm package, just 2 lines:

````javascript
// Set Security Headers.
const helmet = require('helmet')
app.use(helmet())
````

Also, you can set Content Security Policy (CSP) rules using the `helmet-csp` package.

Keep in mind that the contact form on the example site only works on Netlify!!
