This is one of my side projects I started last year. This portfolio site is made with static-site-express and is hosted on the Netlify cloud platform which is specifically made for static websites. You can check out the code [in my Github repository](https://github.com/SalsaBoy990/static-site-express). [Visit the website.](https://static-site-express.netlify.com)

You can have your static website in three steps, for free:
1. Install site generator (clone my repo)
2. Build your website (build and serve locally),
3. Publish it on Netlify (register and add site from Git).

It was a quiet short description of my work. So check out my blogpost with the title of ["static-site-express, a Node.js-based static site generator. Part 1"](https://uifactory.design/2019/09/11/static-site-express-static-site-generator-part-1.html) if you are interested in more.

Have a nice day or night depending on your timezone!
