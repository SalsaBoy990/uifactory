# static-site-express

static-site-express is a simple Node.js based static-site generator that uses EJS and Markdown. You can deploy your static site to Netlify.

*Post updated on Dec 28, 2018*

*Current version: 4.0.0*


**Important notes**

---

  - `nodemon` not trigger re-build on Linux on file changes (this behavior was experienced on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver)
  - On Ubuntu, you can run `npm run watch-exp` command which uses the [chokidar]() package. *Experimental.*


## Install static-site-express

- Use the 'Deploy to Netlify' button on the [example website](https://static-site-express.netlify.com/)

- Or install it from npm package manager:

`npm install static-site-express`


## Build your site locally

Build site from `./src` into `./public` folder:

`npm run build`

Serve website on `localhost:4000`:

`npm run serve`

Or you can watch for changes and trigger re-build with nodemon:

`npm run watch`

You need to add `sudo` before the commands on Linux system.

Inspect `package.json` for more info. The `./lib` folder contains the JavaScript files used for building and serving the website. Check them out.

The `site.config.js` file contains some of the site properties (like site title, author, description, social media links etc.) that are used in the EJS partials.


## Register at Netlify and publish your website

- Register on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and [see this tutorial video](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) if you are unfamiliar with the procedure. You can publish your site in a minute.

- The `netlify.toml` configuration file contains important properties:

````raw
[build]
  base    = "/"
  publish = "public"
  command = "npm run build"
````

The base path, the build command, and the publish directory. You can keep those settings.

In the `_headers` file you can specify the HTTP headers and set Content Security Policy (CSP) rules for the Netlify server. Currently, CSP rules are not set because I don't know which domains you want to whitelist when you create your own website.

The `_redirects` file is currently empty. When you have a custom domain, you can make a redirect from *.netlify.com to your custom domain.

`sitemap.xml` is self-explanatory. Currently empty. robots.txt?

For Google Search Console verification, you should have an HTML file from Google included in the root of your Netlify publish folder (in our case, public). The build script copies this file from `./src` to `./public`. Change line 87 in `./lib/build.js`: 

````javascript
ssg.copyRootFile('YOUR-GOOGLE-FILENAME-COMES-HERE.html', srcPath, distPath)
````

## Alternatively, you can use the Express server app on Heroku (not recommended)

A `Procfile` is already supplied for you with the command to build the site, and after that to run the app server:

`web: npm run heroku`

You need improve security! I already set security headers with the `helmet` npm package, just 2 lines:

````javascript
// Set Security Headers.
const helmet = require('helmet')
app.use(helmet())
````

Also, you can set Content Security Policy (CSP) rules using the `helmet-csp` package. This is just an example:

Keep in mind that the contact form on the example site only works on Netlify!


## The idea of making a static site generator in Node.js

came from this article:

* Douglas Matoso 2017. [Build a static site generator in 40 lines with Node.js](https://medium.com/douglas-matoso-english/build-static-site-generator-nodejs-8969ebe34b22).
